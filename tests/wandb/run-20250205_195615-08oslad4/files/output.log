c:\Users\hamid\OneDrive\Documents\ai-surveyor\env\Lib\site-packages\transformers\generation\utils.py:2137: UserWarning: You are calling .generate() with the `input_ids` being on a device type different than your model's device. `input_ids` is on cuda, whereas the model is on cpu. You may experience unexpected behaviors or slower generation. Please make sure that you have put `input_ids` to the correct device by calling for example input_ids = input_ids.to('cpu') before running `.generate()`.

The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
